## Strategy Pattern

* It is a behavioral pattern that enables us to create objects with
different strategies. 
* The strategies are decided by the client at run-time
using dependency injection.
* It gets rid of complex hierarchical inheritance and uses composition 
to resolve the algorithms/strategies for the object.
