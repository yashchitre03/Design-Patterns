# Strategy Pattern

> It is a behavioral pattern that enables us to create objects with
> different strategies. The strategies are decided by the client at run-time
> using dependency injection.
> It gets rid of complex hierarchical inheritance and uses composition 
> to resolve the algorithms/strategies for the object.
